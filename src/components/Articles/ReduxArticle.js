      <p>
        Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you
        write applications that behave consistently, run in different
        environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. On top
        of that, it provides a great developer experience, such as live code
        editing combined with a time traveling debugger. You can use Redux
        together with React, or with any other view library. It is tiny (2kB,
        including dependencies), but has a large ecosystem of addons available.
